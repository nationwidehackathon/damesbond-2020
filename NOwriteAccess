Per github when I tried to generate a file online, I lack write access to this repo so project must be forked in order for me to push changes.  
To add code from my forked copy, contains 2 additional folders of: local-uploadpdf2S3 and fiddler, create a pull request across forks and then merge my forked code into this repo.
